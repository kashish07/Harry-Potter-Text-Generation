# Harry-Potter-Text-Generation

A NLP model which uses Deep Learning(LSTM) for generating or completing a sentence related to Harry Potter series.

The model is trained on Harry Potter and The Philosopher's stone and the text generated will depend upon how you fit the model on the dataset, if it is overfit then it will just copy the text from the novel.

I will later improve this project with the use of other techniques available.
